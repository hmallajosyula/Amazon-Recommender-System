Capstone Project - Building a Recommender System for Amazon User Reviews

For the Capstone Project required for completion of the Data Science Intensive Workshop I will be looking into Amazon user reviews. 

I begin by working with the user reviews data for BOOKS available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html

Using this unstructured dataset my project will look into the following associations:

A) Word associations: Plot top words used to desribe a positive or a negative rebiew
B) Do certain users tend to post negative reviews most of the time?
C) Is there a Correlation between price and positive reviews..Do higher priced items typically get more positive reviews?
D) Is there a Correlation between positive review and a popular brand?
E) What is the fraction of helpful reviews to total reviews?
F) Do users who rate the product high also tend to buy related products?

For the Machine Learning part, my project would :
A) Build a Recommender system based on previous data to predict user tastes and recommend products that they are more likely to purchase
B) Perform clustering analysis on users to identify similar charecteristics. 

Deliverables will include code (IPYNB NOTEBOOK containing code and plots) and a project write up (.MD file available on this repo)
